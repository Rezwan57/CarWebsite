       <h1 class="heading1">FORD MUSTANG</h1>
       <p class="para1">The Ford Mustang is a series of American
            automobiles manufactured by Ford. In continuous production 
            since 1964, the Mustang is currently the longest-produced Ford car nameplate.
             Currently in its sixth generation, it is the fifth-best selling Ford car nameplate. The namesake of the "pony car" automobile segment,
              the Mustang was developed as a highly styled line of sporty coupes and
             convertibles derived from existing model lines, initially distinguished by
             "long hood, short deck" proportions.
